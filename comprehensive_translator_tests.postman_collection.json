Obesity (BMI 29.1 kg/m²)\\n   * Contributes to overall cardiovascular risk\\n\\n## Plan\\n\\n### Diagnostic\\n1. Cardiac stress test (Exercise stress echocardiogram) - Scheduled for tomorrow\\n2. Complete lipid panel with apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a)\\n3. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring\\n4. Sleep study to evaluate for potential obstructive sleep apnea\\n\\n### Therapeutic\\n1. Cardiovascular\\n   * Increase Lisinopril to 20mg daily for better BP control\\n   * Add Amlodipine 5mg daily\\n   * Continue Aspirin 81mg daily\\n   * Add sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4mg PRN for chest discomfort - instruct on use\\n\\n2. Diabetes Management\\n   * Continue Metformin 1000mg twice daily\\n   * Initiate blood glucose home monitoring fasting and 2 hours post-prandial\\n   * Referral to diabetes education program\\n\\n3. Lipid Management\\n   * Increase Atorvastatin to 40mg daily\\n\\n### Lifestyle Modifications\\n1. Dietary\\n   * Low sodium (<2g daily) DASH diet\\n   * Limit carbohydrates, especially refined sugars\\n   * Increase fiber intake\\n\\n2. Exercise\\n   * Once cleared by stress test, recommend moderate intensity exercise (e.g., walking) for 30 minutes, 5 times per week, gradually increasing as tolerated\\n\\n3. Stress Management\\n   * Sleep hygiene counseling\\n   * Consider mindfulness or meditation techniques\\n\\n### Follow-up\\n1. Return to office in 2 weeks with stress test results\\n2. Cardiology consultation scheduled\\n3. Phone check-in with nurse in 3 days to assess symptoms and medication tolerance\\n\\n## Patient Education\\n\\n* Discussed the nature of coronary artery disease, risk factors, and warning signs of acute coronary syndrome\\n* Reviewed symptoms that should prompt immediate medical attention (severe chest pain, pain radiating to jaw/arm, significant shortness of breath, syncope)\\n* Instructed on proper use of sublingual nitroglycerin\\n* Discussed target blood glucose ranges and monitoring schedule\\n* Provided written information on DASH diet\\n* Encouraged stress reduction techniques\\n\\n## Final Note\\n\\nPlan discussed with patient who verbalized understanding and agreement. All questions addressed. Patient expressed motivation to improve health status and adhere to the recommended plan. Spent 45 minutes with patient, majority of which was counseling and coordination of care.\",\n    \"source_language\": \"en\",\n    \"target_language\": \"es\",\n    \"domain\": \"healthcare\",\n    \"quality_level\": \"high\",\n    \"preserve_formatting\": true,\n    \"provider\": \"openai\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4o\"\n}"
